 Game Show App Project

Part of my Treehouse Tech Degree

The task was to use vanilla JavaScript to create a word guessing game - Wheel of Fotrune style if you will.

The user upon starting the game would recieve a random pre generated phrase, 
in which they would click on on screen letters to check if that letter is included in the phrase to attempt to solve it

coded with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
